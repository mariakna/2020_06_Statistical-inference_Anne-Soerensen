# 2020_6_Statistical-inference_Anne-Soerensen

## Workshop description
You most likely all know about p-values and confidence intervals. But have you truly understood them? Many researches need to take on the role of being the their own statistician when conducting research that includes data analysis. While a larger proportion have started to feel comfortable in the coding aspects, some still feel unease with the statistical inference such as p-values. Many struggle in understanding what to conclude from data analysis concerning point estimates, p-values and confidence intervals. This talk will go beyond the old rule of p-values below 0.05 equals significance and we will discuss the basics of statistical inference using R as a tool of understanding.
